# DetectionAndClassification_UsingCNN
# For this project I used yolov5 to detect vehicle on a road.
- First of all you can go to this link to refer the model
- You can take the weight that I trained follow by this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kNzdSLek9tr7P3biCLBgaUPh4H96aRNc?usp=share_link
# The result after training the model:

As you can seee that My model can detect very well  on car, motorbike, bus and bicycle. the data that I have collected is not enough for the truck so my model recognizes the truck pretty bad!
